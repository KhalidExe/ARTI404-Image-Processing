## 📂 Repository Contents

### ✅ Lab 1: Basics of Programming with Python
This folder contains the practical implementation for Lab 1, focusing on digital image representation and manipulation using Python.

#### 📝 Implemented Tasks:
1.  **Image Loading & Visualization:**
    * Loaded images using **OpenCV** (handled BGR to RGB conversion).
    * Loaded images using **PIL** (Python Imaging Library).
    * Displayed images side-by-side using `matplotlib`.

2.  **Image Storing:**
    * Saved processed images to the disk using both OpenCV and PIL methods.

3.  **Image Representation (Arrays):**
    * Inspected image properties (Shape, Data Type).
    * Converted PIL images to NumPy arrays to understand pixel structure.

4.  **NumPy Assessment & Operations:**
    * **Array Creation:** Generated arrays of Zeros, Ones, and specific ranges (e.g., integers 10-50, even numbers).
    * **Matrix Operations:** Created 3x3 matrices, Identity matrices, and performed reshaping.
    * **Randomization:** Generated random numbers using uniform and standard normal distributions.
    * **Indexing & Slicing:** Performed advanced array extraction (e.g., specific rows, columns, and 2x2 sub-matrices).
